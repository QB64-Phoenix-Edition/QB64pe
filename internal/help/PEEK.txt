The '''PEEK''' function returns the value that is contained at a certain memory address offset. '''QB64 currently has limited access!'''


{{PageSyntax}}
:: variable = PEEK(''segment_offset'')


* Reads the specified memory ''segment_offset'' value.
* Use [[DEF SEG]] before PEEK to specify which memory segment to work in. 
* PEEK only reads the memory byte value. Not certain bits. (See [[AND]])
* Important [[SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN]] segments using [[PEEK]] and [[POKE]] include &amp;HB800 (text segment) and &amp;HA000 (graphics segment).
* To return to Basic default segment use [[DEF SEG]] without any arguments.
* '''Warning: DEF SEG, VARSEG , VARPTR, PEEK or POKE access QB64's emulated 16 bit conventional memory block!''' 
: '''It is highly recommended that QB64's [[_MEM]] memory system be used to avoid running out of memory.'''
