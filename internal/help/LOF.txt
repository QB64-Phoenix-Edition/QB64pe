The [[LOF]] function is used to find the length of an [[OPEN]] file in bytes.



{{PageSyntax}}
: ''totalBytes&amp;'' = [[LOF]]([#]{{Parameter|fileNumber}})


{{PageDescription}}
* LOF returns the number of bytes in an [[OPEN]]ed designated {{Parameter|fileNumber}}. File is empty if it returns 0.
* {{Parameter|fileNumber}} is the number of the opened file. '''#''' is not required.
* Often used to determine the number of records in a [[RANDOM]] access file.
* Can also be used to avoid reading an empty file, which would create an error.
* LOF in '''QB64''' can return up to 9 GB (9,223,372,036 bytes) file sizes.


{{PageExamples}}
''Example:'' Finding the number of records in a RANDOM file using a [[TYPE]] variable.
