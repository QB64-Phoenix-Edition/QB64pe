The '''SADD''' function returns the address of a [[STRING]] variable as an offset from the current data segment.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: SADD(stringvariable)


* The argument may be a simple string variable or a single element of a string array. You may not use fixed-length strings.
* Use this function carefully because strings can move in the BASIC string space storage area at any time.
* Adding characters may produce a run-time error. Don't add characters to the ends of parameters.

* [[VARSEG]], [[VARPTR]], [[DEF SEG]]
