<a name="Usage"></a>
# Usage
Run the ```qb64pe``` executable to launch the IDE, which you can use to edit your .BAS files. From there, hit F5 to compile and run your code.

To generate a binary without running it, hit F11.

Additionally, if you do not wish to use the integrated IDE and to only compile your program, you can use the following command-line calls:

```qb64pe -c yourfile.bas```

```qb64pe -c yourfile.bas -o outputname.exe```

Replacing `-c` with `-x` will compile without opening a separate compiler window.
