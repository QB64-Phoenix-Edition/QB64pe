The [[$CHECKING]] metacommand turns C++ event checking ON or OFF.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[$CHECKING]]:{ON|OFF}

{{PageDescription}}
* The Metacommand does '''not''' require a comment or REM before it. There is no space after the colon.
* The OFF action turns event checking off and should '''only be used when running stable, errorless code.''' 
* The default [[$CHECKING]]:ON action is only required when checking has been turned OFF previously.
* When [[$CHECKING]]:OFF is used, all error code and the reporting code is removed from the EXE program.
* '''Warning: Turning OFF error checking could create a General Protection Fault (or segfault). Use only with 100% stable sections of code.'''

===Details===
* After every QB64 command is translated to C++, the compiler adds special code sections to check for [[ON TIMER (n)]] events and errors that may have occured in the last function call. Disabling error checking with the [[$CHECKING]]:OFF directive prevents the compiler from adding the extra code sections.
* Setting [[$CHECKING]]:OFF is only designed for 100% stable, errorless sections of code, where every CPU cycle saved counts, such as in a software 3D texture mapper, for example.
