The ({{Text|now deprecated|red}}) '''$VIRTUALKEYBOARD''' [[metacommand]] did turn the virtual keyboard ON or OFF.


{{PageSyntax}}
: '''$VIRTUALKEYBOARD:ON'''
: '''$VIRTUALKEYBOARD:OFF'''


{{PageDescription}}
* This metacommand did not require a comment ''[[Apostrophe|']]'' or [[REM]] before it. There was no space between the metacommand name, the colon and the ON/OFF parameter.
* It placed a virtual keyboard on screen, which could be used in touch-enabled devices like Windows tablets.
* {{Text|Deprecated|red}}, in all current versions of QB64 it just generates a warning now, but has no other effect anymore.
