The [[ERASE]] statement is used to clear all data from an array. [[$STATIC]] [[Arrays|array]] dimensions are not affected.


{{PageSyntax}}
: ERASE ''arrayName'' [, ''arrayName2''...]


{{PageDescription}}
* All string array elements become null strings ("") and all numerical array elements become 0.
* Multiple arrays can be erased using commas between the array names.
* [[$DYNAMIC|Dynamic]] arrays must be [[REDIM]]ensioned if they are referenced after erased. 
* Dimension subprocedure arrays as [[STATIC]] to use [[ERASE]] and not have to REDIM.
* You do not have to include array brackets in an [[ERASE]] call.
