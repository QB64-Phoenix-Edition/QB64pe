The [[LOC]] function returns the status of a serial (COM) port received buffer or the current byte position in an open file.


{{PageSyntax}}
: {{Parameter|bytes%}} = LOC({{Parameter|fileOrPortNumber%}})


* {{Parameter|fileOrPortNumber%}} is the number used in the port [[OPEN]] AS statement.
* Returns 0 if the buffer is empty. Any value above 0 indicates the COM port has received data.
* Use it in conjunction with [[INPUT$]] to get the data bytes received.
* Can also be used to read the current position in a file routine. See [[SEEK]].
