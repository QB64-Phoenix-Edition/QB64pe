SLEEP pauses the program indefinitely or for a specified number of seconds, program is unpaused when the user presses a key or when the specified number of seconds has passed.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: SLEEP [seconds]


* Seconds are an optional [[INTEGER]] value. If there is no parameter, then it waits for a keypress.
* Any user keypress will abort the SLEEP time.
* SLEEP does NOT clear the keyboard buffer so it can affect [[INKEY$]], [[INPUT]], [[INPUT$]] and [[LINE INPUT]] reads. 
* Use an [[INKEY$]] keyboard buffer clearing loop when an empty keyboard buffer is necessary.
* SLEEP allows other programs to share the processor time during the interval.
