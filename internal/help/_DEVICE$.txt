{{DISPLAYTITLE:_DEVICE$}}
The '''_DEVICE$''' function returns a [[STRING]] value holding the controller type, name and input types of the input devices on a computer.


{{PageSyntax}}
: {{Parameter|device$}} = _DEVICE$({{Parameter|device_number}})


* The '''[[_DEVICES]] function must be read first to get the number of devices and to enable [[_DEVICE$]] and [[_DEVICEINPUT]].'''
* The {{Parameter|device_number}} parameter indicates the number of the controller device to be read.
* Returns the [[STRING]] control type, name of the device and input types each can use included in brackets:
::* Control type:
::: [KEYBOARD] always listed as first device when keyboard(s) available. Only one keyboard will show.
::: [MOUSE]] always listed as second device when keyboard(s) and mouse(mice) are available. Only one mouse will show.
::: [CONTROLLER] subsequent devices are listed as controllers which include joysticks and game pads.
::* When [CONTROLLER] is returned it may also give the [[STRING]] [[NAME] [device description]] of the controller.
::* Returns the type of input after the device name as one or more of the following types:
::: [{{KW|BUTTON}}] indicates there are button types of input. [[_LASTBUTTON]] can return the number of buttons available. 
::: [{{KW|AXIS}}] indicates there are stick types of input. [[_LASTAXIS]] can return the number of axis available. 
::: [{{KW|WHEEL}}] indicates that a scrolling input can be read. [[_LASTWHEEL]] can return the number of wheels available.

* '''Device numbers above the number of [[_DEVICES|devices]] found will return an OS error.'''
* Devices found include keyboard, mouse, joysticks, game pads and multiple stick game controllers.

:Note: The [[STRIG]]/[[STICK]] commands won't read from the keyboard or mouse device the above example lists. They will only work on controllers.
