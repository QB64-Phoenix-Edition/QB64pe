{{DISPLAYTITLE:_CONSOLE}}
The [[_CONSOLE]] statement can be used to turn a console window ON/OFF.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[_CONSOLE]] {OFF|ON}
: _DEST [[_CONSOLE]]


* [[_CONSOLE]] OFF or ON must be used after the [[$CONSOLE]] [[Metacommand]] has established that a console window is desired.
* [[_CONSOLE]] OFF turns the console window off once a console has been established using [[$CONSOLE]]:ON or ONLY.
* [[_CONSOLE]] ON should only be used after the console window has been turned OFF previously.
* [[_DEST]] [[_CONSOLE]] can be used to send screen output to the console window using QB64 commands such as [[PRINT]].
* [[_SCREENHIDE]] or [[_SCREENSHOW]] can be used to hide or display the main program window.
* The [[$SCREENHIDE]] [[Metacommand]] can hide the main program window throughout a program when only the console is used.
* '''Note:''' Text can be copied partially or totally from console screens in Windows by highlighting and using the title bar menu. 
:: To copy console text output, right click the title bar and select ''Edit'' for ''Mark'' to highlight and repeat to ''Copy''. 


{{PageExamples}}
''Example 1:'' Hiding and displaying a console window. Use [[_DELAY]] to place console in front of main program window.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|$CONSOLE}}
{{Cl|_CONSOLE}} OFF 'close original console
{{Cl|_DELAY}} 2
{{Cl|_CONSOLE}} ON 'place console above program window

{{Cl|_DEST}} {{Cl|_CONSOLE}} 
{{Cl|INPUT}} "Enter your name: ", nme$ 'get program input
{{Cl|_CONSOLE}} OFF 'close console

{{Cl|_DEST}} 0 'destination program window
{{Cl|PRINT}} nme$
{{Cl|END}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
: ''Explanation:'' The [[_DEST|destination]] must be changed with [[_DEST]] [[_CONSOLE]] to get [[INPUT]] from the [[$CONSOLE]] screen.


''Example 2:'' [[_CONSOLETITLE]] can be used to create a console title, but it must be redone every time the console window is restored once turned off:
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|$CONSOLE}}

{{Cl|_CONSOLETITLE}} "firstone"
{{Cl|_DELAY}} 10

{{Cl|_CONSOLE}} OFF
{{Cl|_DELAY}} 10

{{Cl|_CONSOLE}} ON
{{Cl|_CONSOLETITLE}} "secondone"
