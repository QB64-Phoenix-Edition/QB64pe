The '''>''' condition symbol denotes that a value must be greater than another value for the condition to be True. 


''Example usage:'' IF x [[Greater_Than|>]] 320 THEN PRINT "Right of screen"


* Statements will evaluate as True or -1 when the first value is greater or False or 0 when equal or the first value is less. 
* More than one > symbol in a numerical statement will create a [[Boolean]] evaluation of the ensuing numerical value.
