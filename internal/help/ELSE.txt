{{PageDescription}}
* ELSE is used in a IF block statement to cover any remaining conditions not covered in the main block by IF or [[ELSEIF]].
* [[CASE ELSE]] covers any remaining conditions not covered by the other CASE statements.
* ELSE can also be used as a false comparison to a true IF statement when a condition will only be true or false.
* Other [[IF...THEN]] statements can be inside of an ELSE statement.
