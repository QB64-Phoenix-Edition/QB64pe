The '''POS''' function returns the current print cursor text column position.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: column% = POS(0)


* The value in parenthesis is normally  0, but any numerical value or variable could be used for compatibility with Basic.
* When a semicolon ends the previous PRINT statement the cursor column position will be after the last character printed.
* If [[TAB]] or a comma is used the column position will be immediately after the tabbed position normally 9 spaces after text
* If a [[PRINT]] statement does not use a semicolon or comma at the end, the return value will be 1 on the next row.
* Column position returned can be saved to return to a previous print position later using [[LOCATE]].


''Example:'' Column positions after prints.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|PRINT}} {{Cl|POS}}(0) 'column position always starts on 1 at top of new or after {{Cl|CLS}}
{{Cl|PRINT}} "hello"; 'column position is 6 on same row immediately after text
{{Cl|PRINT}} {{Cl|POS}}(0)
{{Cl|PRINT}} 'start new row
{{Cl|PRINT}} "hello", 'column position is 15 on same row (normally tabs 9 spaces)
{{Cl|PRINT}} {{Cl|POS}}(0)
{{Cl|PRINT}} 'start new row
{{Cl|PRINT}}
{{Cl|PRINT}} {{Cl|POS}}(0) ' column position is 1 on next row '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
''Note:'' Column tab prints may not always move 9 spaces past the center of the screen. Some may move text to next row.
