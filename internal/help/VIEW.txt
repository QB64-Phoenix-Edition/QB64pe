The '''VIEW''' statement creates a graphics view port area by defining the coordinate limits to be viewed.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: '''VIEW''' [[SCREEN] (column1, row1)-(column2, row2)[, color][, border]]]


* When the SCREEN option is used, all coordinates are absolute and only graphics within the viewport area are plotted.
* When the SCREEN option is not used, all coordinates are relative to the view port with the values of column1 and row1 being automatically added before plotting the point.
* Coordinate values are for the top left and bottom right values of a box area of the screen mode used. 
* The color parameter specifies a background fill color for the area. None when omitted.
* Border requires any valid color attribute to draw a line around the VIEW area if there is room for it.
* VIEW without any parameters disables the previous viewport. [[RUN]] and [[SCREEN]] can also disable any VIEW port.
* [[CLS]] or [[CLS|CLS 1]] clears the active graphics VIEW port area only. Disable a viewport before attempting to clear the entire screen!
* '''Note: QB64 [[RUN]] statements will not close [[VIEW PRINT]], [[VIEW]] or [[WINDOW]] view ports presently!'''


''Example 1:'' Using SCREEN option with absolute screen coordinates.
{{CodeStart}}
 SCREEN 12
 VIEW SCREEN (200, 200)-(400, 400), 1, 9 ' blue BG with light blue border
 CIRCLE (220, 220), 20, 11 ' using the actual screen coordinates
{{CodeEnd}}


''Example 2:'' Using coordinates relative to the viewport box area.
{{CodeStart}}
 SCREEN 12
 VIEW (200, 200)-(400, 400), 1, 9 
 CIRCLE (20, 20), 20, 11 ' using coordinates inside of the viewport
{{CodeEnd}}

:''Explanation:'' The relative coordinates are automatically adjusted to place the object correctly. Any values outside of the box's area will not be displayed. Both examples should display the same screen image.
