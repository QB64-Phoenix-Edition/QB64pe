Libxmp-lite is a lean and lightweight subset of Libxmp that plays MOD, S3M,
XM, and IT modules and retains full compatibility with the original API.
It's intended for games and small or embedded applications where module
format diversity and file depacking are not required.

Library size can be further reduced by disabling Impulse Tracker format
support (configure with --disable-it). This option will also disable IT
effects and lowpass filtering.

Please refer to http://xmp.sf.net/libxmp.html for details on the current
Libxmp API.

RADv2 - great stuff! I am planning to integrate the included player code in my projects. Can you please
let me know the license type for the player code? If there is one, putting it somewhere on the site or
zip would be fantastic!

Thanks!
