A '''question mark''' can be used as a substitute shortcut to typing PRINT when creating code.


''Usage:'' ?"Hello world"


''Result:'' PRINT "Hello world"


* When the IDE cursor moves to the next code line, the question mark is changed to PRINT and the prompt text and variable are spaced appropriately.
* When an [[INPUT]] statement has no text, a question mark will appear before the input.
* A [[semicolon]] after the [[INPUT]] prompt text will add a question mark after the statement.

* [[PRINT]]
* [[Semicolon]], [[Comma]]
* [[Quotation mark]]
