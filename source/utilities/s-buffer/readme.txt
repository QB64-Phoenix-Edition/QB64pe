This is a massively reduced version of "The Simplebuffer System" library
by RhoSigma. The full package with many more functions for bookmarking,
searching, copy'n'paste and EOL conversion, inclusive documentation and
examples can be downloaded from the respective forum post here:

Note: The sb_qb64_extension.bi/.bm files are not part of the buffer system.
      These files provide glue code for use of the system inside qb64pe.
