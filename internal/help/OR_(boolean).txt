The '''OR''' conditional operator evaluates an expression to true (-1) if any of the arguments is also true.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[IF]] {{Parameter|expression1}} '''OR''' {{Parameter|expression2}} THEN {code}


{{PageDescription}}
* OR adds an alternative to another conditional evaluation. If either element in the evaluation is true then the evaluation is true.
* Parenthesis may be used to clarify the order of comparisons in an evaluation.
* Not to be confused with the [[AND]] and [[OR]] numerical operations.

True
{{OutputEnd}}
