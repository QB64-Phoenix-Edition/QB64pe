The '''=''' condition symbol denotes that a value must equal another value for the condition to be True. 


''Example usage:'' IF x [[=]] 320 THEN PRINT "Center of screen"


* Statements will evaluate as True or -1 when two values are equal or False or 0 when not equal. 
* More than one = symbol in a numerical statement will create a [[Boolean]] evaluation of the ensuing numerical pairs.
:: A = B = C will be converted to A = (B = C) so if B = C then A = -1. If not, then A = 0
