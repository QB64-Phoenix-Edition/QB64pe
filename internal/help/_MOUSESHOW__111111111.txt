{{DISPLAYTITLE:_MOUSESHOW}}
The [[_MOUSESHOW]] statement displays the mouse cursor and can change its shape.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[_MOUSESHOW]] [{{Parameter|cursorShape$}}]


{{PageDescription}}
* Simply use the statement whenever [[_MOUSEHIDE]] has been used previously.
* In '''version 1.000 and up''' the following {{Parameter|cursorShape$}} can be displayed:
:_MOUSESHOW "LINK" will display an upward pointing hand cursor used to denote hypertext
:_MOUSESHOW "TEXT" will display the I cursor often used in text entry areas 
:_MOUSESHOW "CROSSHAIR" will display a crosshair cursor
:_MOUSESHOW "VERTICAL" will display vertical arrow cursor for movement
:_MOUSESHOW "HORIZONTAL" will display horizontal arrow cursor for movement
:_MOUSESHOW "TOPLEFT_BOTTOMRIGHT" will display bottom diagonal arrow cursor for movement
:_MOUSESHOW "TOPRIGHT_BOTTOMLEFT" will display bottom diagonal arrow cursor for movement
:_MOUSESHOW "DEFAULT" can be used after a mouse cursor statement above was previously used.
* This statement will also disable [[_MOUSEMOVEMENTX]] or [[_MOUSEMOVEMENTY]] relative mouse movement reads.
* The mouse cursor will not interfere with any print or graphic screen changes in '''QB64'''.


===QBasic/QuickBASIC===
* _MOUSEHIDE statements do not accumulate like they did with [[CALL ABSOLUTE|ABSOLUTE]] or [[INTERRUPT]] in QBasic.
