{{DISPLAYTITLE:_EXIT (function)}}
The [[_EXIT]] function prevents the user from closing a program and indicates if a user has clicked the close button in the window title ('''X''' button) or used CTRL + BREAK.


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{Parameter|exitSignal%}} = [[_EXIT]]


{{PageDescription}}
* Once the [[_EXIT]] function is used, the user can no longer manually exit the program until it is ended with [[END]] or [[SYSTEM]].
* [[_EXIT]] returns any exit requests made after the initial call as:
:: 0 = no exit request has been made since _EXIT monitoring began in the program.
:: 1 = exit attempted by clicking the window X (close) button since last function call. (Bit 0 set)
:: 2 = exit attempted with CTRL + BREAK since last call. (Bit 1 set)
:: 3 = both CTRL + BREAK and the X box have been used since last call. (Bit 0 and 1 set)
* If a return value is not 0 the program can handle an exit request at a more convenient time if necessary.
* After being read, the _EXIT value is reset to 0 so store the value when a program delays an exit request.
* '''Note: Once _EXIT has been used once, you must monitor your program by checking it for user _EXIT requests.'''
* Don't just use _EXIT once to prevent a user from exiting a program early, as that constitutes bad practice.
