{{DISPLAYTITLE:_FREEIMAGE}}
The '''_FREEIMAGE''' statement releases the designated file image created by the [[_LOADIMAGE]], [[_NEWIMAGE]] or [[_COPYIMAGE]] functions from memory when they are no longer needed.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[_FREEIMAGE]] [{{Parameter|handle&amp;}}]


{{PageDescription}}
*If {{Parameter|handle&amp;}} is omitted, the current destination image is freed from memory.
*Freeing the destination image or source image will result in the display page being selected instead.
*'''Invalid image handle values of -1 or 0 cannot be freed or an [[ERROR Codes|"Illegal Function" error]] will occur.''' Check the handle value first.
* '''[[SCREEN]] modes in use cannot be freed or an [[ERROR Codes|"Illegal Function" error]] will occur.''' Change SCREEN modes before freeing. 
*Once a specific image handle is no longer used or referenced by your program, it can be freed with [[_FREEIMAGE]].
*  '''Images are not deallocated when the [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] they are created in ends. Free them with [[_FREEIMAGE]].'''
* '''It is important to free unused or unneeded images with [[_FREEIMAGE]] to prevent memory overflow errors.'''
* '''Do not try to free image handles currently being used as the active [[SCREEN]]. Change screen modes first.'''


{{PageExamples}}
''Example:'' Loading a program splash screen and freeing image when no longer necessary:
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
s&amp; = {{Cl|_LOADIMAGE}}("SPLASH.BMP",32)  'load 32 bit(24 BPP) image
{{Cl|IF}} s&amp; &lt; -1 THEN {{Cl|SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN}} s&amp;   'use image as a 32 bit SCREEN 
{{Cl|_DELAY}} 6                          'display splash screen for 6 seconds
{{Cl|SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN}} 0       'MUST change screen mode before freeing a SCREEN image!
{{Cl|IF}} s&amp; &lt; -1 THEN {{Cl|_FREEIMAGE}} s&amp;  'handle value MUST be less than -1 or error!
{{Cl|CLS}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
: ''Note:'' A valid image file name must be used by [[_LOADIMAGE]] or the invalid handle memory value will not need to be freed.
