{{DISPLAYTITLE:_CONTINUE}}

The [[_CONTINUE]] statement is used in a [[DO...LOOP]], [[WHILE...WEND]] or [[FOR...NEXT]] block to skip the remaining lines of code in a block (without exiting it) and start the next iteration. It works as a shortcut to a [[GOTO]], but without the need for a [[line numbers|line label]].
