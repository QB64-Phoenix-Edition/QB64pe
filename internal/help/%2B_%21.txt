The '''+''' plus mathematical operator performs addition on two numerical values or [[concatenation|concatenate]] [[STRING]] values. 



''Syntax:'' return_value = number1 + number2



{{PageDescription}}
* A [[+]] sign also can indicate a positive numerical value, but it is not required.
* Numbers used can be any literal or variable numerical value type. 
* Adding one negative value will actually perform subtraction on the other value. 
* Adding two negative values will make the return value more negative.
* Addition and subtraction are the last operations performed in QBasic's normal order of operations.
* The [[+|plus(+)]] operator can also be used to add ([[concatenation|concatenate]]) literal or variable [[STRING]] values.
* [[PRINT]] can also use + operations on string values ONLY! Numerical values will need to be converted to strings first or be included using [[semicolon]]s or [[comma]]s instead.
