*'''[[Keywords currently not supported by QB64|Currently NOT supported in QB64!]]'''
* UEVENT ON enables user defined event-trapping as defined by the [[ON UEVENT]] statement.

* UEVENT OFF disables the event-trapping routine. All events are ignored and are not remembered.

* UEVENT STOP suspends the event-trapping routine. An event is remembered, and the event-trapping routine will be performed as soon as a UEVENT ON statement re-enables the trapping.
