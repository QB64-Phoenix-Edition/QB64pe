{{DISPLAYTITLE:_SOURCE}}
The [[_SOURCE]] statement establishes the image SOURCE using a handle created by [[_LOADIMAGE]], [[_NEWIMAGE]] or [[_COPYIMAGE]].


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[_SOURCE]] {{Parameter|handle&amp;}}


{{PageDescription}}
* The handle is a [[LONG]] integer value from the [[_SOURCE (function)|_SOURCE]] function or a handle created by [[_NEWIMAGE]]. 
* If the handle is designated as 0, it refers to the current [[SCREEN]] image.
* A source image can only supply information to a program. [[POINT]] and [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] might require a source other than the one currently active.

: ''Explanation:'' Create a new image with handle 'a', then use [[_DEST]] to define the image to draw on. Draw a pixel then set the source to 'a' and use [[POINT]] to show what color is in that position. White (15) and is the color set with [[PSET]]. Use [[_DEST]] 0 for the screen to display the results.
