The [[WRITE (file statement)|WRITE #]] file statement writes a list of comma separated variable values to a sequential file or port.


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{KW|WRITE (file statement)|WRITE #}}{{Parameter|filenumber&amp;}}[, {{Parameter|expressionList}}]


{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|filenumber&amp;}} is the number of the file or device {{KW|OPEN}}ed in the {{KW|OUTPUT}} or {{KW|APPEND}} modes. See: {{KW|FREEFILE}}.
* {{Parameter|expressionList}} is a comma-separated list of values to be written to the file or device.
* WRITE can place any number and types of variable values needed in a file record separated by commas.
* String values will have quotation marks although quotes are not required to read strings in CSV files with [[INPUT (file statement)|INPUT]] #.
* Data files using WRITE normally will have the same number of values listed on each file line.
* Data containing commas must be in quotation marks. Number commas are illegal!
* WRITE created files are normally read with INPUT #.
* CSV files created can be read by Excel using a .CSV file name extension. Strings may or may not include quotation marks.
* [[Semicolon]]s cannot be used in or following the WRITE statement!
