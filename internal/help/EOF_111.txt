The [[EOF]] function indicates that the end of a file has been reached.


{{PageSyntax}}
: {{Parameter|endReached%%}} =  EOF([#]{{Parameter|fileNumber&}})


{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|fileNumber&}} is the number of the file being read. '''#''' is not required.
* Returns 0 until the end of a file. This avoids a file read error.
* Returns -1 (true) at the end of the file.
<!-- confusing statement; further details are required: * [[CHR$]](26) can be used to denote the end of a file. -->
* '''Note that [[GET]] can return invalid data at the end of a file.''' Read [[EOF]] after a GET operation to see if the end of the file has been reached and discard last read.
