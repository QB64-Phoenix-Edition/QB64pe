The '''SEEK''' function returns the current byte or record position in a file.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: byte = SEEK(filenumber&amp;)


* Filenumber is the number of an [[OPEN]] file in any mode.
* In [[RANDOM]] files SEEK returns the current record position.
* In [[BINARY]] or sequencial files SEEK returns the current byte position(first byte = 1).
* Since the first file position is 1 it may require adding one to an offset value when documentation uses that position as 0.
* Devices that do not support SEEK (SCRN, CONS, KBRD, COMn and LPTn) return 0.
