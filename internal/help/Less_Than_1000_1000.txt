The '''<''' condition symbol denotes that a value must be less than another value for the condition to be True. 


''Example usage:'' IF x [[Less_Than|<]] 320 THEN PRINT "Left of screen"


* Statements will evaluate as True or -1 when the first value is less or False or 0 when the first value is equal or greater. 
* More than one < symbol in a numerical statement will create a [[Boolean]] evaluation of the ensuing numerical value.
