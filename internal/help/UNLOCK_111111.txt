{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|fileNumber%}} is the file number of the file to unlock.
* In the first syntax, the entire file is unlocked.
* In the second syntax, {{Parameter|record&}} is the record number of the file to unlock.
* In the third syntax, the records or bytes in the range [{{Parameter|firstRecord&}},{{Parameter|lastRecord&}}] are unlocked. If {{Parameter|firstRecord&}} is omitted, it is assumed to be the first record or byte.
* For files opened in [[BINARY]] mode, each record corresponds to a single byte.
* [[LOCK]] and [[UNLOCK]] statements are always used in pairs and each statement must match the other one.
* Files must be unlocked before other programs can access them, and before the file is closed.
