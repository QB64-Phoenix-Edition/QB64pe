The '''semicolon''' is used in a [[PRINT]] statement to stop the screen print cursor immediately after the printed value. 


''Usage:'' COLOR 13: PRINT "Value ="; value1; value2; value3

{{OutputStart}}{{text|1234  5678  9012|magenta}}{{OutputEnd}}


* Positive numerical values [[PRINT|printed]] will include a space before and after each value printed. Strings will not have spacing.
* Use the [[WRITE]] statement to print values with only commas between the values and no spacing.
* A semicolon can append the next print when used at the end of a [[PRINT]] statement.
* Use a semicolon after text that will be [[PRINT|printed]] on the last two text rows of a [[SCREEN (statement)|screen mode]] to prevent screen rolling.
* [[INPUT]] statements can use the semicolon '''before''' the text to prevent screen rolling. '''INPUT ; "text or question"; variable'''.
* A semicolon '''after''' the text will create a question mark and space after the [[INPUT]] text question. Use a comma for statements.
* '''NOTE: Semicolons can NOT be used to combine string variables in a string variable definition!''' 
* Use the '''+''' [[concatenation]] operator to combine [[STRING|string]] variable definition values only! 
* [[Semicolon]]s cannot be used in or following a [[WRITE]] statement!
