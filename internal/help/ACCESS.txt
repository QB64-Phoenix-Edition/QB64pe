#REDIRECT [[OPEN#File_ACCESS_and_LOCK_Permissions]]

The [[ACCESS]] clause is used in an [[OPEN]] statement when working over a network.


{{PageSyntax}}
:OPEN "file.dat" FOR APPEND ['''ACCESS {READ|WRITE}'''] AS #1

{{PageDescription}}
* Valid Options:
**Default: When specified, all other processes are denied file access.
**READ: When specified, read access is denied to other file procedures.
**WRITE: When specified, write access is denied to other file procedures.
**READ WRITE: When specified any access is denied to other file procedures.


===Limitations===
*If another process already has access to a specified file, program access is denied for that file OPEN access. A "Permission Denied" error 70 will be returned. A network program must be able to handle a denial of access error.
