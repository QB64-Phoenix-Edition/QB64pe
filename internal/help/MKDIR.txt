The [[MKDIR]] statement creates a new folder ('''dir'''ectory) at a specified path.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[MKDIR]] pathSpec$


{{PageDescription}}
* The path specification (pathSpec$) is a literal or variable [[STRING]] expression that also specifies the new folder's name.
* If no path is given the directory will become a sub-directory of the present directory where the program is currently running.
* '''QB64''' can use both long or short path and file names with spaces when required.
* The new folder will be created without a user prompt or verification. 
* If a path is specified, the path must exist or a [[ERROR Codes|"Path not found" error]] will occur. See [[_DIREXISTS]].
* [[SHELL]] can use the DOS command "MD " or "MKDIR " + path$ + newfolder$ to do the same thing.
