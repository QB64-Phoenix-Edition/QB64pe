[[$COLOR]] is a metacommand that adds named color [[CONST|constants]] in a program.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[$COLOR]]:0
: [[$COLOR]]:32


{{PageDescription}}
* [[$COLOR]]:0 adds [[CONST|constants]] for colors 0-15. The actual constant names can be found in the file '''source/utilities/color0.bi'''.
* [[$COLOR]]:32 adds [[CONST|constants]] for 32-bit colors, similar to HTML color names. The actual constant names can be found in the file '''source/utilities/color32.bi'''.
* [[$COLOR]] is a shorthand to manually using [[$INCLUDE]] pointing to the files listed above.
* Prior to QBPE v0.5 ({{Text|ü|red}}), [[$COLOR]] was not compatible with [[$NOPREFIX]].
* Since QBPE v0.5, [[$COLOR]] can now be used with [[$NOPREFIX]], with a few notable differences to three conflicting colors -- Red, Green, Blue.

:Red would conflict with [[_RED]], Green would conflict with [[_GREEN]], and Blue would conflict with [[_BLUE]], once the underscore was removed from those commands with [[$NOPREFIX]].
:
:To prevent these conflicts, the [[COLOR]] values have had '''NP_''' prepended to the front of them, to distinguish them from the non-prefixed command names.  All other color names remain the same, with only the three colors in conflict having to use '''NP_''' (for '''N'''o '''P'''refix) in front of them.
