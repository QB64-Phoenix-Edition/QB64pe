{{DISPLAYTITLE:_SNDPLAYFILE}} 
The [[_SNDPLAYFILE]] statement is used to play a sound file without generating a handle, automatically closing it after playback finishes.


{{PageSyntax}}
:[[_SNDPLAYFILE]] {{Parameter|filename$}}[, {{Parameter|ignored%}}][, {{Parameter|volume!}}]


{{PageDescription}}
* Supported file formats are '''WAV, OGG and MP3'''. See [[_SNDOPEN]].
* {{Parameter|ignored%}} is an optional parameter , accepted for historical reasons.
** In versions prior to '''build 20170811/60''', {{Parameter|ignored%}} identified if a sound was to be loaded with [[_SNDOPEN|"SYNC" capabilities]], (-1 for true, 0 for false). This is true for all sound files in the latest versions, making this parameter safe to be ignored.
* {{Parameter|volume!}} is a [[SINGLE]] value from 0 (silence) to 1 (full volume). If not used or outside this range, the sound will be played at full volume.
* [[_SNDPLAYFILE]] never creates an error. If the sound cannot be played it takes no further action.
* The sound is closed automatically after it finishes playing.
* When a sound will be used often, open the file with [[_SNDOPEN]] and use [[_SNDPLAYCOPY]] to play the handle instead to reduce the burden on the computer.
