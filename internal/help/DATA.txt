The [[DATA]] statement creates a line of fixed program information separated by commas. The DATA can be later READ by the program at runtime.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[DATA]] [value1, value2, ...]


{{PageDescription}}
* DATA is used at the beginning of every data field line with commas separating the values that follow.
* Values can be any '''literal''' [[STRING]] or numerical type. '''Variables cannot be used.'''
* DATA fields can be placed and READ consecutively in the main program code body with or without line labels for [[RESTORE]]. 
* DATA is best placed after the main program code.
** '''QB64''' DATA can be placed inside a [[SUB]] or  [[FUNCTION]] procedures.
* [[RESTORE]] will only read the first data field if the DATA is not labeled or no label is specified in a RESTORE call.
* When using multiple DATA fields, label each data field with a line label so that each data pointer can be reset for multiple reads with '''[[RESTORE]] ''linelabel'''''.
* QBasic comma separations were flexible to allow column alignments when creating them. QB64 removes spacing between commas.
* [[STRING]] DATA values with end spaces, QBasic keywords and values that include the comma character must be enclosed in quotation marks.
* DATA fields can only be created by the programmer and cannot be changed by a user or lost.
* Comments after a data line require a colon before the comment.
* If a [[READ]] statement attempts to read past the last data value, an [[ERROR Codes|"Out of Data" error]] will occur. Use end of data markers when necessary.
* '''[[DATA]] fields can be placed after [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedures, but line labels are not allowed.'''
